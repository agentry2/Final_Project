This project creates a Monopoly-like game using JavaFX. It is quite barebones compared to actual Monopoly as it doesn't have things like trading, mortgaging or auctioning. I plan on tinkering with it more after the semester to see what I can do with it.

There are two panes. The pane showing the board and the pane with the game's controls. When you run the program, you'll have to hit the "Start a new game". If you click the roll button before doing this, the terminal will tell you that the start button has not been pressed. Once you start the game, there will be four players. Click the roll button to move forward. The terminal will show you how far you've moved. If you've landed on an unowned property and you can afford it, you will be prompted to hit the "Buy" or "Don't buy" button. If you land on another player's property, you will lose money equal to the property's value.

The game ends when only one player isn't bankrupt. The game will register this after a few rolls and the terminal will once again display "The game has not started".

The only library you should need is javafx.controls.
